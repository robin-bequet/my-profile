                <p>Currently a student at IESEG School of Management, I'm passionate about music 🎵, travel ✈️ and perfume 😉. And thanks to this course, I now love coding and would like to explore it further.</p>

                <h2>Music 🎶</h2>
                <p>Since I was young, music has always held a special place in my life. It accompanies me every day, sets the rhythm of my days, and offers a unique escape. Whether I’m listening, singing, or discovering new styles, music is more than just a passion — it’s a part of who I am.</p>

                <h2>Travel 🧳</h2>
                <p>Since childhood, travel has always been a big part of my life. For me, it’s an endless source of discovery and growth. Setting off on adventures, exploring new horizons, and experiencing different cultures — it’s more than a passion; it’s a way of seeing the world from a fresh perspective with each journey.</p>

                <h2>Perfume 😮‍💨</h2>
                <p>Fragrances have always held a special place in my life. They allow me to travel through scents, evoke memories, and create unique atmospheres. Each fragrance tells a story, and discovering new perfumes is an endless pleasure for me, a way to express who I am and escape with just a breath of aroma.</p>
